# challenge-real-world-api

This challenge was part of my Front-End Development Bootcamp.

The instructions of the challenge are below:
When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

### When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

- The city name

- The date

- An icon representation of weather conditions

- The temperature

- The humidity

- The wind speed

### When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

- The date

- An icon representation of weather conditions

- The temperature

- The humidity

### When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

As a resource for my javaScript I followed Drew's speedrun.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to solve this challenge.
